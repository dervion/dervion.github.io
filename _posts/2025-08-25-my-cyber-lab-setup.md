title: "My Cyber Lab Setup"

I set up my very first **cyber lab environment** ðŸš€.

**Tools I used:**
- GitHub Student Pack (free credits & tools)
- Oracle Free Tier (Ubuntu VM)
- DigitalOcean (extra VMs)
- Datadog (monitoring)

**Steps I followed:**
1. Created two Ubuntu VMs.
2. Installed Datadog agents.
3. Verified system metrics were being collected.

**Reflection:**  
This setup gives me a safe environment to practice without breaking my main computer. Next, Iâ€™ll tackle **OverTheWire Bandit** for Linux command-line basics.
