To setup this blog I did the following things:

1. Signed up with Namecheap domain to acquire terve.me
2. Changed the nameserver to Cloudflare for other security features.
3. Used a GitHub Jekyll theme- Minimal, for my blog publishing.
4. Created yml file for the theme integration and _posts folder for my blog entries.
5. Edited the DNS records to fix it due to issues encountered as the Cloudflare SSL features conflicted with GitHub.
6. Setup my email to work thru Cloudflare via Gmail using this guide:
