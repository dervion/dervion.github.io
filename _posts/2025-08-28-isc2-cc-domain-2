Domain 2 Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts

Incident Terminology
Breach- compromise of authorized (more than they were authorized for) or unauthorized user

Event- observable occurrence in network/system

Exploit- attack vs. vulnerability

Incident- event vs CIA of system

Intrusion- security event wherein intruder gains or try to gain access without authorization

Threat- circumstance/event to adversely impact via unauthorized access

Vulnerability- weakness in system

Zero day- unknown vulnerability with exploitation potential

Goal of incident response (crisis management)
-protect life, health and safety
-always choose safety
-be prepared
-orgs must have IR plan
-reducing impact so the org can continue the disrupted activity

Business continuity
red book- outside facility to continue operations, hard copy backups

Some components:
-List of business continuity plan, contacts, backup numbers
-immediate response and safety procedure
-notification system/ call tree
-guidance for management / designation of authority
-how, when to enact the plan
-contact numbers for critical members of supply chain (vendors, customers)

e.g. Fire occurred in one department
-department function important but not immediately affecting other areas of business
-temporary setup for optimize
-customer service staff alternative to handle the main concern of the department affected
-1 week without the department is acceptable
-company has cash reserves to manage staying afloat

Business continuity
-Sustain business ops while disruption
-key: communication & backup
-established procedures and checklists
-management, supply chain, law enforcement

in US, military grade networks, can be used in case of disruptions for e.g. hospitals cyberattacks

Incident Response plan
-all employees should follow based on their role in the process

Preparation- Detection & Analysis - Containment, eradication & recovery - Post-incident activity

Preparation
-develop management approved policy
-identify critical data and systems train staff
-implemented incident identification
-identify roles
-plan communication / primary communication backup

Detection and Analysis
-Monitor all possible attack vector
-Analyze incident via threat intel
-Prioritize incident response
-Standardize incident documentation

Containment
-gather evidence
-choose containment strategy
identify attacker
-isolate attack

Post-incident activity
-identify evidence (retained)
-document lessons learned
-review all over again the steps

Goals of disaster recovery
-disaster response plan (DRP) guides action of emergency response until end goal(restoration of business)
-restoring IT, comms, systems

Business continuity plan vs DRP- maintaining critical business function vs. restoring IT and comms after disruption

Components of DRP
-executive summary (high level overview)
-department specific plans
-technical guides for IT personnel(critical backup systems)
-full copies of the plan for DR members

Checklists:
-DR team will have checklists
-IT personnel technical guides for alternate sites up and running
-managers and PR staff will have high level, simple docs for communicating accurately

Business continuity
-enabling critical functions even reduced capacity vs. disruption
-involves planning, preparation, response and recovery operations
-not generously full restoration of business
-needs organizational support
