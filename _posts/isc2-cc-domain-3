Access Controls Concepts

Security Control- safeguard to preserve CIA
e.g. firewall- prevent something coming in or going out

Access
-restrict/allow access

Components:
Subject- entity that requests access to asset
-active, have permission
e.g. user, process, procedure, client, server

Object- anything that subject attempts to access
-passive, must be protected, IAM system, has owner, may have classification
e.g. building, computer, file, database, printer, scanner, thread, process

Rule- to allow or deny access to an object by comparing identity of subject
-against access control list, multiple attributes, how much is allowed, apply time-based access
e.g. firewall access control list

Defense in depth- layered defense strategy by org
-integrates people, tech, ops to establish multiple barriers to deter attacks
e.g. username, password, code, MFA
firewalls vs. trusted networks vs. different level of sensitive info

physical - logical - administrative controls - assets

Physical access control -tangible to limit
e.g. security guard, camera, fence

logical access control - electronic methods to limit someone
e.g. passwords, biometrics, badge

administrative access control- policies and procedures

Defense in depth
e.g. data center - admin- P&P, logical tech- tool, physical -facility

Control- to reduce risk vs risk tolerance of org
-physical and administrative controls
e.g. seatbelt, traffic laws
bookshelf attached to wall, building codes

Controls assessment- risk reduction depends on effectiveness of control, -must adapt
e.g. location with 5 doors vs need, type/kind of asset, may just use a deadbolt

Role-based control
-role created for work function
-when they leave the role, admin removes the access
-works well with high turnover work environment
-needs to check permission regularly to avoid privilege/permission creep
-recommended to create standards based on the role vs the user

Privilege access management
-to avoid having permissions always on vs. just-in-time privilege (only when necessary)
-role based subsets of privilege

Privileged accounts
-with permission beyond normal users
-elevated privileges
-based on trustworthiness
e.g. system admins, helpdesk/IT, security analyst

Measures vs. possible misuse
-extensive logging
-stringent, access control than regular - just-in-time identity, MFA
-deeper trust verification - more background checking, stricter NDA, review
-more auditing e.g. helpdesk personnel resetting passwords, compare daily logs vs. customer tickets

Monitoring-physical access controls, auditing, and logging

e.g. cameras -crime deterrent, surveillance
logs- record of events, log retention, -log anomaly- to identify security-related issues
alarm system-commonly found in doors or windows -e.g. fire alarm, panic button

Security guards-effective physical control
